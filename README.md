Hello all!
This project, the site I created completely by myself. 
I hope this project will help you in your research and endeavors in this field. 
And yes - I did it as an order, but the customer treated and treats me like "crap", so you can see this project here.
And yes, do not mock the fullstack programmers, after all they are human too and deserve a good attitude.
Using it for commercial purposes can lead to some responsibility. 
To use it for commercial purposes - ask my permission in writing.

To contact me or just, you need any help - feel free to contact me in telegram: @pi4is
